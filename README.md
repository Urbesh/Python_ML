👋 About This Repo

This repository documents my Python learning journey as a 3rd-year CSE (AIML) B.Tech student, with the goal of becoming a Machine Learning Engineer.

I already know the basics of Python, but I’m revising and strengthening fundamentals before moving into Data Science, ML libraries, advanced Python, and ML engineering practices.

This repo contains:

📂 Daily practice problems

📂 Daily Mini Project

📂 Projects for each week

📂 Phase-wise structured learning (5 phases)

📑 Notes and resources

🛣️ Roadmap (5 Phases)

Phase 1: Python Fundamentals

Basics, Data structures, OOP, File handling, Error handling

Phase 2: Python for Data & ML
