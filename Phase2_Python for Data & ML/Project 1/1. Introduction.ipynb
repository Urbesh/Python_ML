    "# Welcome to CodeBook – Your Data Science Internship Begins!\n",
    "\n",
    "## **Introduction**\n",
    "Congratulations! You have just been hired as a **Data Scientist Intern** at **CodeBook – The Social Media for Coders**. This Delhi based company is offering you a **₹10 LPA job** if you successfully complete this **1-month internship**. But before you get there, you must prove your skills using **only Python**—no pandas, NumPy, or fancy libraries!\n",
    "\n",
    "Your manager Puneet Kumar has assigned you your **first task**: analyzing a data dump of CodeBook users using pure python. Your job is to **load and explore the data** to understand its structure.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## **Task 1: Load the User Data**\n",
    "Your manager has given you a dataset containing information about CodeBook users, their connections (friends), and the pages they have liked.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is how the data will look like (in JSON format):\n",
    "```json\n",
    "{\n",
    "    \"users\": [\n",
    "        {\"id\": 1, \"name\": \"Amit\", \"friends\": [2, 3], \"liked_pages\": [101]},\n",
    "        {\"id\": 2, \"name\": \"Priya\", \"friends\": [1, 4], \"liked_pages\": [102]},\n",
    "        {\"id\": 3, \"name\": \"Rahul\", \"friends\": [1], \"liked_pages\": [101, 103]},\n",
    "        {\"id\": 4, \"name\": \"Sara\", \"friends\": [2], \"liked_pages\": [104]}\n",
    "    ],\n",
    "    \"pages\": [\n",
    "        {\"id\": 101, \"name\": \"Python Developers\"},\n",
    "        {\"id\": 102, \"name\": \"Data Science Enthusiasts\"},\n",
    "        {\"id\": 103, \"name\": \"AI & ML Community\"},\n",
    "        {\"id\": 104, \"name\": \"Web Dev Hub\"}\n",
    "    ]\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "Read this data and understand its structure. The data contains three main components:\n",
    "1. **Users**: Each user has an ID, name, a list of friends (by their IDs), and a list of liked pages (by their IDs).\n",
    "2. **Pages**: Each page has an ID and a name.\n",
    "3. **Connections**: Users can have multiple friends and can like multiple pages.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## **Task 2: Read and Display the Data using Python**\n",
    "Your goal is to **load** this data and **print** it in a structured way. Use Python's built-in modules to accomplish this.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Steps:**\n",
    "1. Save the JSON data in a file (`codebook_data.json`).\n",
    "2. Read the JSON file using Python.\n",
    "3. Print user details and their connections.\n",
    "4. Print available pages.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## **Expected Output:**\n",
    "```\n",
    "Users and Their Connections:\n",
    "Amit (ID: 1) - Friends: [2, 3] - Liked Pages: [101]\n",
    "Priya (ID: 2) - Friends: [1, 4] - Liked Pages: [102]\n",
    "Rahul (ID: 3) - Friends: [1] - Liked Pages: [101, 103]\n",
    "Sara (ID: 4) - Friends: [2] - Liked Pages: [104]\n",
    "\n",
    "Pages:\n",
    "101: Python Developers\n",
    "102: Data Science Enthusiasts\n",
    "103: AI & ML Community\n",
    "104: Web Dev Hub\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## **Next Steps**\n",
    "Your manager is happy with your progress but says: **\"The data looks messy. Can you clean and structure it better?\"**\n",
    " \n",
