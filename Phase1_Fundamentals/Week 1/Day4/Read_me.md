I have been using conditional statements from the very start of my Python programming journey,
since I knew the basics of Python programming. But I am practicing conditional statements again 
just because it a part of my Python learning module. I don't know why I wrote this cuz I don't
think anyone is going to visit this repo and find anything useful.
But if you are still reading this, that means you might have find something useful.
Thankyou for visiting my repo.
